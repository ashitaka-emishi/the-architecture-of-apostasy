# SDLC Workflow

Use this skill to keep issue-driven GitHub work consistent and auditable.

## Operating Principles

- Start from the GitHub issue or milestone whenever possible.
- Prefer one issue per branch and one branch per pull request.
- Keep scope narrow; create follow-up issues for new work discovered along the way.
- Preserve unrelated user changes in the working tree.
- Never edit essay content in `raw/` or `markdown/` as a side effect of SDLC work — that guardrail (see `raw/recommended-improvements.md`) overrides normal "smallest coherent change" judgment. Essay-content issues (milestone "M6: Essay-Level Revisions") additionally require explicit owner sign-off before implementation starts, not just before merge.
- Update any relevant `tracking` issue when child issues close or change order/status.
- Open pull requests as ready for review, not draft.
- Keep a human control point between pull request creation and merge. Do not merge or close issues unless the user explicitly asks for that workflow or has clearly delegated it.
- Always use squash merge for pull requests. Do not use merge commits or rebase merge unless the user explicitly overrides this rule for a specific PR.

## Command Interpretation

Treat `sdlc`, `sldc`, and `$sdlc-workflow` as requests to use this workflow. `sldc` is an accepted shorthand/typo, not a reason to ask for clarification.

Issue-number commands are issue-directed workflow requests:

```text
sdlc <issue-number>
sldc <issue-number>
sdlc implement issue <issue-number>
use sdlc to finish #<issue-number>
```

The number is not a magic value. For example, `sldc 33` means inspect and start or continue issue #33, while `sldc 22` means inspect and start or continue issue #22.

Multi-issue commands are ordered batch workflow requests. Interpret comma-separated issue numbers and inclusive ranges as an ordered list, preserving the user's order:

```text
sdlc 7-12,26-31
sdlc 16,19,22
sldc 26-31
```

For a multi-issue request, do each issue completely before starting the next one. "Complete" means:

1. inspect the issue state with the deterministic helper;
2. implement or perform the required planning/issue-management work;
3. validate at the appropriate depth;
4. open a ready PR when code or repository files changed;
5. merge/close that issue before moving to the next issue;
6. update relevant tracking issues;
7. sync the base branch and confirm a clean working tree before starting the next issue.

The multi-issue form is explicit merge/close delegation for every listed issue. It satisfies the human control point for each issue in the batch, so do not stop after opening each PR unless checks fail, review blocks the PR, the issue is ambiguous, or the user interrupts. For planning-only issues with no branch or PR, complete the required GitHub issue work, add a completion comment when useful, close the issue, and update the tracker before moving on. If an issue is already closed, report it and continue to the next listed issue unless the user asked to reopen or revise it. If any issue is blocked, stop the batch and report the blocker, completed issues, and the smallest next action.

Any issue under milestone "M6: Essay-Level Revisions" is an exception to batch delegation: stop and get explicit per-issue approval before creating a branch or editing files, even inside a multi-issue batch command, because those issues edit existing essay content.

`sdlc next` and `sldc next` are selection requests, not implementation approval. For these requests, inspect open issues and relevant tracker/milestone ordering, choose the next recommended issue, explain the selection briefly, and stop for user confirmation before creating a branch, editing files, or otherwise starting implementation.

For any equivalent request, first collect deterministic state for the referenced issue, determine its current status, and then choose the smallest correct continuation:

- If the issue is open and no implementation branch/PR exists, start issue work.
- If a branch exists, inspect local/remote branch state and continue from it when safe.
- If an open PR exists, inspect its status, checks, review comments, and remaining scope before changing code.
- If the issue is already closed, report the closure state and do not create new work unless the user asks to reopen or follow up.

## Deterministic Helpers

Use bundled scripts for repeatable state collection and formatting. Keep judgment-based decisions in the agent: scope, intended base branch, implementation approach, validation depth, review risk, and whether a human has delegated merge/close authority.

For issue-directed work, run the state helper before creating a branch, editing files, opening a PR, addressing review, or merging:

```bash
python3 .agents/skills/sdlc-workflow/scripts/sdlc_state.py inspect-issue <issue-number> --repo ashitaka-emishi/the-architecture-of-apostasy --cwd .
```

Use `--json` when the next step needs machine-readable output. Treat the helper output as the factual baseline for issue state, local status, matching local/remote branches, open PRs, PR checks, review decision, and same-milestone `tracking` issues. If the helper reports unavailable state, stop and report the exact unavailable command instead of inventing state.

For tracker updates after merge, format checklist entries with:

```bash
python3 .agents/skills/sdlc-workflow/scripts/sdlc_state.py tracker-entry <issue-number> --title "<issue title>" --state closed --url "<issue URL>"
```

## Start Issue Work

1. Run `sdlc_state.py inspect-issue` for the issue and read the issue, linked tracking issue, or milestone details it reports.
2. Use the helper's local status and branch report to avoid duplicating existing issue branches.
3. If the work needs code or docs changes, create a branch from the intended base branch.
4. Name the branch by issue type:
   - `fix/<issue-number>-<short-slug>`
   - `feature/<issue-number>-<short-slug>`
   - `docs/<issue-number>-<short-slug>`
   - `chore/<issue-number>-<short-slug>`
5. If the helper reports an open same-milestone issue labeled `tracking`, keep it in mind for closure updates.

## Implement

1. Inspect the relevant files before editing.
2. Make the smallest coherent change that satisfies the issue.
3. Keep generated artifacts and source edits separate when practical.
4. Run validation scaled to the blast radius.

For this project, full validation is:

```bash
python3 ai-system/scripts/theological_consistency_check.py
quarto render
```

For a docs-only change confined to a single page, running `quarto render` is usually sufficient; run the consistency check as well whenever `ai-system/`, `architecture-of-apostasy/`, or cross-references between them are touched.

## Pre-PR Codex Review

Before opening a pull request, perform a Codex code review over the staged or intended PR diff. Use the standard review stance: prioritize bugs, behavioral regressions, broken validation, missing tests, schema drift, source-risk gaps, and documentation mismatches. For this project, also check for guardrail violations: silent edits to `raw/` or `markdown/` essay content, new canonical terms introduced outside `architecture-of-apostasy/grammar-of-apostasy/`, and missing Christological resolution on canonical-marked chapters.

Handle findings before PR creation:

1. Fix actionable in-scope findings with the smallest change.
2. Re-run validation scaled to the fix.
3. Perform a second-pass analysis after fixes to decide whether another review is needed:
   - run another review when fixes are non-trivial, touch shared behavior, change validation, or alter generated artifacts;
   - skip another review only when fixes are mechanical or documentation-only and the second-pass analysis finds no new risk.
4. For real problems that are out of PR scope or intentionally deferred, create separate GitHub issues labeled `tech debt`. If the label does not exist, create it with a concise description before filing the first issue.
5. Mention any filed tech-debt issues in the PR body under known limitations or follow-up work.

## Commit

1. Review the diff before staging.
2. Stage only files that belong to the issue.
3. Use a concise imperative commit message.
4. Mention the issue number in the commit body when helpful.
5. Add exactly one AI co-contributor trailer to the commit body when an AI agent materially performed the work:
   - When the acting agent is Codex or OpenAI Codex, use `Co-authored-by: OpenAI Codex <codex@openai.com>`.
   - When the acting agent is Claude or Claude Code, use `Co-authored-by: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>`.
   - Do not use a generic AI trailer, and do not include both Codex and Claude unless both materially contributed to the same commit.
   - Preserve any human `Co-authored-by` trailers separately.

## Open A Pull Request

1. Push the branch.
2. Confirm the pre-PR Codex review has run and either all actionable findings are fixed or out-of-scope findings have tech-debt issues.
3. Open a ready PR, not a draft PR.
4. Include:
   - linked issue, using `Closes #N` only when merge should close it
   - summary of changes
   - validation commands and results
   - known limitations or follow-up work
   - tech-debt issues filed for deferred findings, if any
5. Stop after PR creation unless the user explicitly asks to merge. This preserves the human control point before merge.
   - In a multi-issue command, the batch request itself is explicit merge authorization for every issue except those under "M6: Essay-Level Revisions". Continue into Merge And Close for the current issue once checks are passing.

## Address Review

1. Read review comments and classify each as actionable, question, or out of scope.
2. Fix actionable items with the smallest change.
3. Re-run the relevant validation.
4. Perform a second-pass analysis to decide whether another review pass is needed before proceeding:
   - request or run another review when fixes are complex, risky, or touch areas not covered by the original review;
   - proceed without another review only when the second-pass analysis finds the fix mechanical and low risk.
5. File `tech debt` issues for valid review findings not addressed in the PR.
6. Push a follow-up commit.
7. Reply or summarize what changed, especially for comments not fully addressed.

## Merge And Close

Only do this when the user explicitly asks.

1. Run `sdlc_state.py inspect-issue` again and confirm the PR is approved or the user wants to merge despite pending review.
2. Confirm required checks and validation have passed from helper output, GitHub, and local validation, or clearly report any skipped checks.
3. Merge with squash merge.
4. Confirm linked issues closed as expected.
5. For each closed milestone issue, update the open same-milestone issue labeled `tracking`, using `tracker-entry` output for checklist formatting:
   - check off the issue
   - note out-of-order completion or dependency changes
   - close the tracking issue only when its completion definition is met
6. Inspect the updated tracker, dependencies, and existing branch/PR state, then suggest the next recommended ticket without starting it.

## If Blocked

Report the exact blocker, what was verified, and the smallest next action. Do not invent branch, PR, merge, or review state; check GitHub or local git first.
